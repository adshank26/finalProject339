      <h1>Homework Guide</h1>
      <p>Homework is a big part of where the learning takes place in SI 339. Homeworks take place in the form of website projects that test the knowledge you learn during lecture</p>

      <h2> Here are some things to keep in mind for homework: </h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li> Homework is always due on Friday at midnight. </li>
        <li> Homework that utilizes an autograder may be submitted up to 3 times. </li>  
        <li> Homework will be reviewed after any autograders for additional deductions for inefficient code, plagiarism, etc.</li>
        <li>A 1% late penalty that is applied for each partial day that the assignment is submitted late. No homework may be submitted past 8:00 am Monday.  There are no extensions on homework assignments, but there is partial credit. </li>
        <li> In the case of illness students may be able to drop one homework assignment. The typical plan will be for you to review the assignment, meet up with the instructor during Office Hours to do an oral review of the work, and then have the assignment waived.</li>

      </ul>

        <h2> Homework Tips </h2>
        <p> Some tips and tricks after taking this course:  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plan and manage your time effectively: Web development requires a lot of time and effort. To manage your time effectively, make sure you plan out your week in advance and set specific goals for what you want to accomplish each day. Create a to-do list and prioritize the most important tasks first. Avoid procrastinating and utilize your time wisely.</li>
            <li> Practice coding regularly: Consistent practice is key to becoming a successful web developer. Dedicate at least a few hours every day to coding, and make sure to practice concepts you have learned in class. If you struggle with a particular topic, review it until you fully understand it. Join coding communities to get more insights from experts in the field. </li>
            <li>Collaborate with classmates: Web development is a collaborative field, and working with your classmates can be a great way to learn and improve your skills. Form study groups and discuss the concepts you've learned in class. This will help you gain new perspectives and insights, and it's also a great way to reduce stress</li>
            <li>Take breaks and manage stress: Coding can be mentally exhausting, so it's important to take breaks and manage your stress. Take a 10-15 minute break every hour, stretch your body, walk around, or listen to music. Find what helps you relax and incorporate it into your daily routine. If you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed, don't hesitate to talk to your instructor or a counselor.</li>
            <li> Lastly, try your best and remember... C's get degrees ;) </li>
  
        </ul>
